# Password Logger
> Secure Java Password Logbook Application

Password Log stores website information, usernames, and passwords on a text file. However,
when saved onto a file all passwords are stored securely and hashed. Later when running the
program and having to access the information, the program will unhash and print the user's
password.

## Usage example

Password Log can be useful for those that can't remember their passwords on certain websites.
It also allows you to secure each password securely on your computer without having to save it on a cloud.
